I am a PhD candidate in Department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). My research interests lie in the field of theoretical computer science, especially algorithmic game theory, network design problems, and online algorithms. I am co-advised by [Elena Grigorescu](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/egrigore/) and [Th√†nh Nguyen](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~nguye161/).
